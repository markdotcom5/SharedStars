            <h2>How SharedStars Was Born</h2>
            <div class="story-content">
                <p>At one of the lowest points in my life, I grappled with a profound sense of despair—not just from personal challenges but also from a dream that felt impossibly out of reach. Space travel, with its astronomical costs ranging from hundreds of thousands to millions of dollars, seemed like a privilege reserved for only the wealthiest.</p>
                <p>During this time, I discovered <em>The Three-Body Problem</em> trilogy by Liu Cixin. Its exploration of humanity’s resilience, ingenuity, and collective drive to overcome impossible odds ignited a spark within me. The story reminded me that innovation and collective effort can achieve what once seemed unattainable.</p>
                <p>I realized space travel doesn’t have to remain an exclusive pursuit for the elite. From that moment of inspiration, SharedStars was born. It’s not just a platform; it’s a movement. SharedStars is dedicated to democratizing space travel by providing education, community, and opportunities for anyone willing to dream big and prepare for the next frontier.</p>
